# CMP 420 - Final Project

# In this project: 
- I used MySQL workbench to create a database that stores and keeps records of a tutoring center. 
- We are keeping track of every single employee that works here by assining and emplID number that serves as the primary key. 
- We are storing all the different courses that the tutoring center has to offer, the tutees that are present during tutoring hours and also keeping track of book and study tool loans.
